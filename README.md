## CSS

### Question #1

Describe the purpose of a clearfix in CSS, and give an example of how to do it.

Your Answer:
```Floated elements can vertically overflow their containers by default. To force their containers to adjust to an element's size instead, you can use an :after pseudoselector to insert a blank string after each instance of the element, which the container will stretch to wrap around.
```

### Question #2

What does the following selector do?  `ul.dropdown > li`?

Select 1:
```
[x] Selects all li's which are directly inside a ul of class dropdown (children)
[] Selects all li's which are anywhere inside a ul of class dropdown (any descendant)
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, as well as the children elements that are li's
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, only if their children are exclusively li's
```

## Scope/Context/Closures

### Question #3

Describe the rules of scope in JavaScript.

Your Answer:
```JavaScript functions can only recognize variables declared within themselves or their parent function. This means variables declared within functions will not be recognized globally, and global variables will not be recognized by functions within functions unless they are scoped in using bind or self=this.
```


### Question #4

Define an object and store it in a variable `pizza`. The object should have 2
properties: a temperature (set to 70), and a method called `bake`. When called,
this method should set the pizza's temperature to be 300. Note: you may not use
the variable pizza inside your method.

Your Answer:
```js
var pizza = {
  temperature: 70,
  bake: function(){
    this.temperature = 300;
  }
}
```

## Callbacks

### Question #5

**Define a function called `doSomething`. It should take one argument, called
`thingToDo`. When called, `doSomething` should invoke the function given as an
argument. Finally, demonstrate calling `doSomething` with a function.**

Your Answer:
```js
function doSomething(thingToDo){
  thingToDo();
}

function thingToDo(){
  alert("The thing has been done.");
}

$(".hover-here-to-do-a-thing").hover(dosomething());
```

### Question #6

**What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous program execution?**

Select all that apply:
```
[] Synchronous code runs at an even pace, asynchronous code runs with uneven pacing.
[] Synchronous code runs all at the same time, asynchronous code runs completely randomly
[x] Synchronous code runs in order (as appears in the source), asynchronous code may run at a later time.
```
