## CSS

### Question #1

Describe the purpose of a clearfix in CSS, and give an example of how to do it.
Your Answer:

- A clearfix is a way for an element to automatically clear its child elements, so that you don't need to add additional markup.

<div class="container clearfix">
    <div class="content">other content stuff...</div>
    <div class="sidebar">Sidebar stuff...</div>
</div>

.clearfix:after {
     visibility: hidden;
     display: block;
     font-size: 0;
     content: " ";
     clear: both;
     height: 0;
     }
.clearfix { display: inline-block; }




### Question #2

What does the following selector do?  `ul.dropdown > li`?

Select 1:
```
[X] Selects all li's which are directly inside a ul of class dropdown (children)
[] Selects all li's which are anywhere inside a ul of class dropdown (any descendant)
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, as well as the children elements that are li's
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, only if their children are exclusively li's
```

## Scope/Context/Closures

### Question #3

Describe the rules of scope in JavaScript.

Your Answer:
Scope refers to where variables and functions are accessible, and in what context it is being executed. Basically, a variable or function can be defined in a global or local scope. Variables have so-called function scope, and functions have the same scope as variables.

### Question #4

Define an object and store it in a variable `pizza`. The object should have 2
properties: a temperature (set to 70), and a method called `bake`. When called,
this method should set the pizza's temperature to be 300. Note: you may not use
the variable pizza inside your method.

Your Answer:
```
var pizza = {
  temperature: 70,
  bake: function(){
    this.temperature = 300;
    console.log( this );
  }
}
pizza.bake();

```

## Callbacks


### Question #5

**Define a function called `doSomething`. It should take one argument, called
`thingToDo`. When called, `doSomething` should invoke the function given as an
argument. Finally, demonstrate calling `doSomething` with a function.**

Your Answer:
```js
function doSomething (thingToDo, upper ) {
	var a = Math.floor(Math.random() * upper ) + 1;
	return a;
}
doSomething();

```

### Question #6

**What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous program execution?**

Select all that apply:
```
[] Synchronous code runs at an even pace, asynchronous code runs with uneven pacing.
[] Synchronous code runs all at the same time, asynchronous code runs completely randomly
[X] Synchronous code runs in order (as appears in the source), asynchronous code may run at a later time.
```

## Git

### Question #7

Which of the following represents a correct workflow for submitting a PR on a non-master branch?
(ignore the lack of commit messages)

Select 1:
```
[X] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <ga_dc_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] git clone <ga_dc_url>; git branch <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git pull; create pull request
```

## jQuery

### Question #8

Which of the following statements will work, assuming jQuery is loaded?

Select all that apply:
```
[] `$(".post").css("background", "peachpuff")`
[] `$(".post").innerHTML`
[] `$(".post").html()`
[X] `document.getElementsByClassName("post")[0].innerHTML`
[] `document.getElementsByClassName("post").innerHTML`
```

### Question #9

Using jQuery, add an event listener for clicks on the button with the id
'greeting'. When the event happens, the code should append a paragraph to the
body, that says "hello".

Your Answer:
```js
// your code here
$("#greeting").on("click", appendBody);
function appendBody(){
 $("body").append("<p>Hello</p>");
}
```
