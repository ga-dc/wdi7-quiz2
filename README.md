## CSS

### Question #1

Describe the purpose of a clearfix in CSS, and give an example of how to do it.

Your Answer:
```
a clearfix is used to contain floated elements that would otherwise run outside of it its given container.

example:
if you have an image floated to the left, and text that you would like to add below that, the text div would typically wrap around.  By using the clearfix it will essentially add an element around the image.:

img {
  float: left;
}

div {
  clear:both;
}

```

### Question #2

What does the following selector do?  `ul.dropdown > li`?

Select 1:
```
[x] Selects all li's which are directly inside a ul of class dropdown (children)
[x] Selects all li's which are anywhere inside a ul of class dropdown (any descendant)
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, as well as the children elements that are li's
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, only if their children are exclusively li's
```

## Scope/Context/Closures

### Question #3

Describe the rules of scope in JavaScript.

Your Answer:
```
variables created without the "var" call are global no matter where they are
variables created with "var" are created within the scope of its given environment (ie. if within a finction, it cannot be used outside of that function)
scope looks inward, but not outward. So a variable created in a function can be called iin a second function that is created within the first. however, if a variable is created in that second function, it cannot be used in the first.
functions create local scopes
```


### Question #4

Define an object and store it in a variable `pizza`. The object should have 2
properties: a temperature (set to 70), and a method called `bake`. When called,
this method should set the pizza's temperature to be 300. Note: you may not use
the variable pizza inside your method.

Your Answer:
```js
// write code here
var pizza = {
  temperature:70,
  bake: function () {
    this.temperature = 300;
  }
}
```

## Callbacks

### Question #5

**Define a function called `doSomething`. It should take one argument, called
`thingToDo`. When called, `doSomething` should invoke the function given as an
argument. Finally, demonstrate calling `doSomething` with a function.**

Your Answer:
```js
// write code here
var doSomething = function (thingToDo) {
  thingToDo();
}
$("body").on("click", function () {
  doSomething();
})
```

### Question #6

**What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous program execution?**

Select all that apply:
```
[] Synchronous code runs at an even pace, asynchronous code runs with uneven pacing.
[] Synchronous code runs all at the same time, asynchronous code runs completely randomly
[x] Synchronous code runs in order (as appears in the source), asynchronous code may run at a later time.
```

[] git clone <ga_dc_url>; git branch <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git pull; create pull request
