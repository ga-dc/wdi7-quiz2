## CSS

### Question #1

[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, only if their children are exclusively li's
```

2.  Only functions can create local scope.
3.  Variable created with the 'var' keyword are created in the current local scope.
4.  The current scope includes all enclosing scopes.
```


### Question #4

Define an object and store it in a variable `pizza`. The object should have 2
properties: a temperature (set to 70), and a method called `bake`. When called,
this method should set the pizza's temperature to be 300. Note: you may not use
the variable pizza inside your method.

Your Answer:
```js
var pizza = {
  temperature: 70,
  bake: function(){
    this.temperature = 300;
  }
};
```

## Callbacks

### Question #5

**Define a function called `doSomething`. It should take one argument, called
`thingToDo`. When called, `doSomething` should invoke the function given as an
argument. Finally, demonstrate calling `doSomething` with a function.**

Your Answer:
```js
doSomething(somethingDone);

function doSomething(thingToDo){
  thingToDo();
}

function somethingDone(){
  document.write("Something is being done.")
}

```

```
