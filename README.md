## CSS

### Question #1

Describe the purpose of a clearfix in CSS, and give an example of how to do it.

Your Answer:
```
When child elements are floated, they are taken out of the normal flow of the document (and the container) and the containing element may "collapse" or have no height.

A clearfix is a way to prevent layout issues when a containing element has floated children without creating an empty <div> with the "clear:both" css property.

This problem can more elegantly be fixed by using the "clearfix" technique, which allows you to add a class (like "clear" or "clearfix") to the containing element. See an example of the CSS below:

.clearfix:after {
  display: table;
  clear: both;
  content: '';
}
```

### Question #2

What does the following selector do?  `ul.dropdown > li`?

Select 1:
```
[X] Selects all li's which are directly inside a ul of class dropdown (children)
[] Selects all li's which are anywhere inside a ul of class dropdown (any descendant)
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, as well as the children elements that are li's
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, only if their children are exclusively li's
```

## Scope/Context/Closures

### Question #3

Describe the rules of scope in JavaScript.

Your Answer:
```
- Variables created without the "var" keyword are placed in the global scope.
- Variables create with the "var" keyword are created in the local scope.
- All functions (and only functions) create a new local scope.
- The current scope includes all outer (enclosing) scopes.
```


### Question #4

Define an object and store it in a variable `pizza`. The object should have 2
properties: a temperature (set to 70), and a method called `bake`. When called,
this method should set the pizza's temperature to be 300. Note: you may not use
the variable pizza inside your method.

Your Answer:
```js
// write code here
var pizza = {
  "temperature": 70,
  "bake": function() {
    this.temperature = 300;
  }
}
```

## Callbacks

### Question #5

**Define a function called `doSomething`. It should take one argument, called
`thingToDo`. When called, thing to do should invoke the function given as an
argument. Finally, demonstrate calling `doSomething` with a function.**

Your Answer:
```js
// write code here
var doSomething = function(thingToDo) {
  thingToDo();
}

doSomething(function(){
  console.log("I did the thing!");
});
```

### Question #6

**What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous program execution?**

Select all that apply:
```
[] Synchronous code runs at an even pace, asynchronous code runs with uneven pacing.
[] Synchronous code runs all at the same time, asynchronous code runs completely randomly
[X] Synchronous code runs in order (as appears in the source), asynchronous code may run at a later time.
```

## Git

### Question #7

Which of the following represents a correct workflow for submitting a PR on a non-master branch?
(ignore the lack of commit messages)

Select 1:
```
[X] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <ga_dc_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] git clone <ga_dc_url>; git branch <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git push; create pull request
[] fork on github; git clone <fork_url>; git checkout -b <charlie_solution>; git add <files>; git commit; git pull; create pull request
```

## jQuery

### Question #8

Which of the following statements will work, assuming jQuery is loaded?

Select all that apply:
```
[X] `$(".post").css("background", "peachpuff")`
[] `$(".post").innerHTML`
[X] `$(".post").html()`
[X] `document.getElementsByClassName("post")[0].innerHTML`
[] `document.getElementsByClassName("post").innerHTML`
```

### Question #9

Using jQuery, add an event listener for clicks on the button with the id
'greeting'. When the event happens, the code should append a paragraph to the
body, that says "hello".

Your Answer:
```js
// your code here
$("#greeting").on("click", function() {
  $("body").append("<p>hello</p>");
});
```

## Software Development Processes

### Question #10

Create a readme.md in that repo. In the readme, write out five (5) user stories for your first project. Be sure to include a
role, goal, and reason for each.

Finally, link to your repo on github in the space below.
